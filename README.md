# Grid Art Piece

First programming college assignment. Learning the basics of Java

Developed an art piece using java on Processing.   

Showing use of 
* bespoke methods
* mouse methods
* string methods
* if statements
* for/while/do while loops
* nesting loops

 Brief description of piece:
 ===================================================
 The art piece follows a regular grid theme using light colours,
 rounded rectangles, circle targets and gridlines.
 
 
 Adobe Color Palette Used:
 =========================
LINK: https://color.adobe.com/explore?page=2
* color 1: babyBlue (189, 228, 255)
* color 2: darkBlue (134, 152, 217)
* color 3: lilac (174, 161, 240)
* color 4: purple (180, 132, 217)
* color 5: pink (245, 150, 250)
* color WHITE: (255)
 
 Instructions:
 =============
* Pressing any key causes the circles to change position
* Pressing the Right mouse button saves the assignment .PNG
* Pressing the Left mouse button causes the rectangles to change wight and height
* Hoovering the mouse over text will cause the text to repeat
* Pressing the mouse over the text on either the top or bottom of the screen will cause the text to change colour
 
 Known bugs/problems:
 ====================
 The left corner circle is repeatedly drawn

## Marking Scheme: 

 Part A - Mark (5 /5)
 -----------------------------
 
 Comments - 1/1
 indente/formatted - 1/1
 naming - 1/1
 includsion of Readme - 1/1
 includsion of Reflection - 1/1
 
 Having reviewed my work according to the detailed rubric above, in relation to naming,
 commenting, indentation, and submitting my readme and reflection I have complete 5 of
 these fully. I am recording 5/5
 
 PART A:(5/5)
 
 Part B - Mark (2 /2)
 -----------------------------
 
 Sizing.
 
 I have sized the display window correctly so 1/2.
 
 I have positioned the display window correctly so 1/2.
 
 PART B: (2/2)
 
 Part C - Mark (5 /5)
 -----------------------------
 line 357 - draw()
 line 001 - setup()
 
 Setup and draw are fully working for me, so I score myself excellent 100%. 5/5
 
 PART C: (5/5)
 
 Part D - Mark (8 /10)
 -----------------------------
 Use of if statements:
 
 I have multiple if statements, with multiple branches and
 in nested loops with line number shown.
 
 I used if statement on lines 172, 233 and 248
 I used a nested if on line 113
 I have if statements with multiple branches on lines 29 and 314
 I used if statements inside loops on lines 277 and 298
 
 With respect to the marking scheme I would give myself a very good mark.
 In order to get an excellent mark I could have added another nested if
 with booleen conditions.
 
 I am recording a very good mark for this. 85%
 
 PART D: (8/10)
 
 Part E: (20/20)
 -----------------------------
 Loops
 
 I have 5 loops types in my code at lines 156, 206, 275 
 290 and 332
 
 I have for loops in my code at lines 156, 206
 I have while loops in my code at lines 275
 Nesting is demonstrated on lines 206
 A for inside a for (lines 206, 332)
 A while indise a while (line 275)
 A for inside a while (line 290)
 
 With respect to the marking scheme I would give myself an excellent.
 I have multiple examples of loops and nested loops
 I am recording an excellent mark for this. 100%
 
 PART E: (20/20)
 
 Part F: (18/20)
 -----------------------------
 Bespoke Method
 
 I have 8 bespoke methods
 They are called in lines 158, 222, 300, 338, 342, 344, 346, 348, 351
 360, 361.
 
 Line 22 shows a method with 8 parameters and no return value.
 Line 89 and 152 shows a method with 4 parameters and no return value.
 Line 136 shows a method with 2 parameters and a return value.
 Line 268, 195, 312 and 329 and shows a method with no parameters and no return value.
 
 Line 68 shows an overloaded method with 5 parameters and a return value.
 Line 73 shows an overloaded method with 3 parameters and a return value.
 
 With respect to the marking scheme I would give myself an excellent.
 In order to get a perfect mark I could have added an overloaded method
 I’m recording an excellent mark for this 90%
 
 90% of 20, is 18/20
 
 PART F: (18/20)
 
 Part G: (10/10)
 -----------------------------
 Processing Method calls – (nothing for setup() and draw(), nothing for mouse methods, or
 string methods)
 
 I have called 9 Processing methods
 
 strokeWeight
 rect
 fill
 random
 line
 fill
 ellipse
 stroke
 text
 textSize
 background
 
 at lines 24, 25, 31-82, 92, 158, 197-202, 208, 209
 213-216, 218-220, 235-236, 250-251, 281, 286, 293, 301,
 316, 319
 
 With respect to the marking scheme I would give myself an excellent. 100%
 
 PART G: (10/10)
 
 Part H: (8/10)
 -----------------------------
 Mouse Methods – NOTE not mouse system variables
 
 I have used 3 Mouse methods
 
 mousePressed line 110
 mouseClicked line 231
  mouseReleased line 246
 
 With respect to the marking scheme I would give myself an excellent. 80%
 In order to get a perfect score, I could have made some of the mouse methods
 more complex
 
 PART H: (8/10)
 
 Part I: (7/10)
 -----------------------------
 String Methods (i.e. methods called from the Java String class)
 
 I have used 3 String methods
 
 charAt line 281 and 301
 substring line 286
 compareTo line 314 and 317
 
 I’m recording a very good mark for this. 75%
 That’s a mark of 7.5/10 but rounding would bring me to the next grade so I truncate instead
 giving 7/10
 
 PART I: (7/10)
 
 Part J: (3/3)
 -----------------------------
 My program saves the display in a PNG file on a right mouse click 3/3
 
 PART J: (3/3)
 
 Part K: (5/5)
 -----------------------------
 I have a unique looking final image based on the regular grid theme. 
 The cell contents uses colours, transparency , randomness, text, 
 shapes overlayed on each other. It’s also interactive – if you press 
 any keys the circles change position, pressing the mouse causes the 
 rectangles to change shape, hoovering the mouse over text will cause 
 the text to repeat, pressing over the text will cause it to change 
 colour. I will be uploading it to GitHub! 5/5.
 
 Part K: (5/5)
 
 Overall mark
 5+2+5+8+20+18+10+8+7+3+5= 91
